# bas /L

Bas is an interpreter for the classic dialect of the programming language
BASIC.  It is pretty compatible to typical BASIC interpreters of the 1980s,
unlike some other UNIX BASIC interpreters, that implement a different
syntax, breaking compatibility to existing programs.

This is Lisias' fork, aimed to historical reference and experimentation.
